What:           /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../trigger
Date:           March 2021
Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This is the sysfs interface for manual software
		triggers.The user can simply enter a 1 against
		the sysfs file and enable a manual trigger.
		Example:
		echo  1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../trigger

What:           /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../enable
Date:           March 2021
Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This sysfs interface is used for enabling the
		the dcc hardware.Without this being set to 1,
		the dcc hardware ceases to function.
		Example:
		echo  0 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../enable
		(disable interface)
		echo  1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../enable
		(enable interface)

What:           /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../config
Date:           March 2021
Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This is the most commonly used sysfs interface
		file and this basically stores the addresses of
		the registers which needs to be read in case of
		a hardware crash or manual software triggers.
		Example:
		echo  0x80000010 10 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/../config
		This specifies that 10 words starting from address
		0x80000010 is to be read.In case there are no words to be
		specified we can simply enter the address.

What:           /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../config_write
Date:           March 2021
Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This file allows user to write a value to the register
		address given as argument.The values are entered in the
		form of <register_address> <value>.The reason for this
		feature of dcc is that for accessing certain registers
		it is necessary to set some bits of soe other register.
		That is achievable by giving DCC this privelege.
		Example:
		echo 0x80000000 0xFF > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../config_write

What:           /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../config_reset
Date:           March 2021
Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This file is used to reset the configuration of
		a dcc driver to the default configuration.
		Example:
		echo  1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../config_reset

What:           /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../loop
Date:		March 2021
Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This file is used to enter the loop count as dcc
		driver gives the option to loop multiple times on
		the same register and store the values for each
		loop.This is done to capture the changing values
		of a register with time which comes handy for
		debugging purposes.
		Example:
		echo 10 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/loop
		(Setting the loop count to 10)
		echo  0x80000010 10 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../config
                (Read 10 words starting from address 0x80000010O)
		echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../loop
		(Terminate the loop by writing a count of 1 to the loop sysfs node)

What:           /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../rd_mod_wr
Date:           March 2021
Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This file is used to read the value of the register
		and then write the value given as an argument to the
		register address in config.The address argument should
		be given of the form <mask> <value>.For debugging
		purposes sometimes we need to first read from a register
		and then set some values to the register.
		Example:
		echo 0x80000000 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../config
		(Set the address in config file)
		echo 0xF 0xA > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../rd_mod_wr
		(Provide the mask and the value to write)

What:           /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../ready
Date:           March 2021
Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This file is used to check the status of the dcc
		hardware if it's ready to take the inputs.
		Example:
		cat /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../ready

What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/.../curr_list
Date:		February 2021
Contact:	Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
Description:
		This attribute is used to enter the linklist to be
		used while appending addresses.The range of values
		for this can be from 0 to 3.This feature is given in
		order to use certain linkedlist for certain debugging
		purposes.
		Example:
		echo 0 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/curr_list
